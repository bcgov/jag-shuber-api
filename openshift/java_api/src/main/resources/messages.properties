# NOTE: Spring will populate keys for you based on the Entity and field, so if you
# use a key of 'error.validation.exists' and your entity is 'Sheriff' and field is 'badgeNo'
# you will get a property of 'error.validation.exists.Sheriff.badgeNo'
# typically these properties would be in a file ValidationMessages.properties, but we are using SpringValidatorAdapter to override java/hibernate validation scheme
